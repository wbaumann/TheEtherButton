# TheEtherButton

> An [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)-based version of Reddit's [r/TheButton](https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/) game. The button counts down from 20 blocks. You will be awarded an [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/) token flair when you click the button, but you may only do so once. And the block counter will reset to 20 as soon as you do. Choose wisely...

## Overview

[The Button was an online meta-game and social experiment that featured an online button and 60 second countdown timer that would reset each time the button was pressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)). We thought it would be fun to create the same concept but on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Install

This project requires both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle). Once you have the former, you can install the latter via:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

## Deployment

Next, you'll need to launch truffle:

```bash
truffle develop
```

To compile and deploy the Smart Contract:

```bash
$ truffle(develop)> compile
$ truffle(develop)> migrate

```

Please note that if you are seeing an error like:

```bash
Attempting to run transaction which calls a contract function, but recipient address 0xabcdef.... is not a contract address
```

Be sure to add the `--reset` flag to the `migrate` command like:

```bash
truffle(develop)> migrate --reset
```

One the migration completes, you'll like see an output similar to what is shown above. Be sure to note the address to which the contract deployed (`0x4e72770760c011647d4873f60a3cf6cdea896cd8` in the example above). To simplify future interactions with this address, we recommend saving this as a local variable:

```bash
truffle(develop)> address = "0x4e72770760c011647d4873f60a3cf6cdea896cd8"
```

Once complete, you can start `npm` as usual to test your development work:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Deployment to the BlockChain

Prior to deployment, it is recommended that you flatten all source files into a single one with [truffle-flattener](https://github.com/alcuadrado/truffle-flattener).

```bash
truffle-flattener ButtonClickGameContract.sol >> FlattenedContract.sol
```

Once complete, you can upload your flattened contract to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a web based IDE. Using a combination of MetaMask and the deploy functionality on this page, you should be able to deploy the contract fairly easily.

*Note: I found Remix to be far easier and more consistent to use that Truffle, which may merely be due to deployment misconfigurations on my end.*

## Starting the Game

Once the game has been deployed, you can start it via the Truffle contract via the following command by replacing the sample address with the contract one:

```bash
truffle(develop)> ButtonClickGameContract.at(address).startGame()
```

Button clicks can be initiated via the following command:

```bash
truffle(develop)> ButtonClickGameContract.at(address).clickButton({value: 500000000000000})
```

Finally if you are on a local test network, you can simulate mined blocks by running the following command:

```bash
truffle(develop)> web3.currentProvider.sendAsync({jsonrpc: "2.0", method: "evm_mine", id: 12345}, () => {})
```

## EtherScan

The game's contract is available on Etherscan:

* Ropsten: [0x945687adcc12b818c46f4dc6834712ed40345093](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x945687adcc12b818c46f4dc6834712ed40345093)
* MainNet: [0xdeafc8d49ea6d6044eaa53f5e7c7c35c60e13d7f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeafc8d49ea6d6044eaa53f5e7c7c35c60e13d7f)

Using the same flattened contract as before, we can upload the source to our Etherscan page:

* [Etherscan Contract Verification](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract?a=0x1326a7cf4f7366a4f5308f5e53dea238b72fd3b9)

Please note that the contract name in the verification must be `ButtonClickGameContract` in order to match our deployment.

## Web Deployment

For convenience, we use GitHub Pages as our hosting for this site. Deployments can be done via the [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) tool, which is included in our `package.json` file. Deployments can be run as follows:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
